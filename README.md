## Development

This project was created in the Robotics M1 Course at MOSIG, INP Grenoble, France. As a team, we implemented an assistant robot while extending the provided design. We tested it meticulously and presented our solution, achieving an overall very good grade. The lessons from this project span asynchronous group work management, ROS skills, the importance of detailed testing, and lots of debugging. Lastly, we would like to thank our supervisor, Philip Scales.
