1) Basic use case

Interact with one person, come back home.


2) Too far from base

While moving to the person, the person walks away past the `max_base_distance`.
The threshold can be set to a lower value for demonstration.

Expected result: robot comes back home.

3) Obstacle in the way

Expected result: We don't handle that explicitly, apart from stopping in front of an obstacle. 
Ideally, robot should wait until the obstacle is gone, and then continue.
